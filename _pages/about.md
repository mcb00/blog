Well howdy!
I'm Matt Bowers.
I'm a data scientist at Uber where I specialize in using statistical modeling and machine learning to make large-scale telematics data useful.
Before Uber I earned an MS in Applied Statistics and a PhD in Atmospheric Sciences at Purdue University where I studied the spatial-temporal correlation structure of tropical convection systems and developed statistical methods for climate research.
I was also an [Insight Data Science](https://insightfellows.com/data-science) fellow at Silicon Valley in the summer of 2017.
